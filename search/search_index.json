Here you will find Guides mainly for Sonarr/Radarr/Bazarr and everything related to it. How this all started \u00b6 When I started using Sonarr/Radarr, I noticed that it didn't grab the releases that I actually wanted, as I'm a bit picky about which releases and what quality I prefer. So I decided to fine tune it to try to get the releases & quality I preferred. On Discord, I also noticed that others run in to the same issue so I explained them how I managed to get it solved. Being that I had to explain it often, I decided to write it down and make it public so I could easily link it to someone when they needed it. After a while I also decided to create guides for frequently asked questions, and started to collect all kind of information gathered from various sources. The guides I make I try to make them as easy as possible for everyone to understand, in my opinion pictures explain often more then just some text. Support \u00b6 If you have questions, suggestions, requests or want to contribute, Click the chat badge to join the Discord Channel where you can ask your questions directly or use the following link to open a issue on GitHub. Feel free to create a PR if you want to. DISCLAIMER \u00b6 The information I use for the guides is information I have gathered from different sources like their support forum, Reddit or Discord, provided by user input or from the development team itself. I have tested most things myself and I have tried to see if I could tune them a bit more to my needs and sometimes even for others. You use everything here at your own risk. I won't be responsible if something happens to your setup or collection! Special Thanks \u00b6 iXNyNe aka nemchik for introducing me in the world of dockers with DockSTARTer, and helping me to learn the basics for it. Roxedus for helping me with the transfer/conversion of my Github guides to MkDocs and make everything look great. rg9400 for the providing most of the Radarr v3 Custom Format Collection.

FAQ \u00b6 What are Hardlinks \u00b6 What are hardlinks? - [CLICK TO EXPAND] [ Short answer ] Having a file in multiple locations without using double your storage space. [ Long answer ] Hard links are a way for a copy operation to be instant and not consume space for those additional copies. Every file is a hard link: some metadata that points at blocks on the file system, which is why they're restricted to the same file system . There can be as many metadata files pointing at those blocks as needed and the blocks know how many links point to them. Once the blocks have 0 links, they're considered deleted. This means: You can delete any \"copy\" w/o impacting the others. Your download client can remove it's \"copy\" w/o impacting the library \"copy\". The library \"copy\" can be removed by Plex or Sonarr/Radarr or yourself w/o impacting the download client \"copy\". Space is only regained when all \"copies\" are deleted. Modifying the file will impact all \"copies\". For example, modifying the id3 tags of a .mp3 download after import would modify the download client \"copy\", resulting in breaking the torrent.

There can be as many metadata files pointing at those blocks as needed and the blocks know how many links point to them. Once the blocks have 0 links, they're considered deleted. This means: You can delete any \"copy\" w/o impacting the others. Your download client can remove it's \"copy\" w/o impacting the library \"copy\". The library \"copy\" can be removed by Plex or Sonarr/Radarr or yourself w/o impacting the download client \"copy\". Space is only regained when all \"copies\" are deleted. Modifying the file will impact all \"copies\". For example, modifying the id3 tags of a .mp3 download after import would modify the download client \"copy\", resulting in breaking the torrent.","title":"What are Hardlinks"},{"location":"Hardlinks/Hardlinks-and-Instant-Moves/#what-are-instant-moves-atomic-moves","text":"What are Instant Moves (Atomic Moves)? - [CLICK TO EXPAND] A real move and not a copy file from download folder to media folder and then delete file from download folder.","title":"What are Instant Moves (Atomic Moves)"},{"location":"Hardlinks/Hardlinks-and-Instant-Moves/#what-are-the-arr","text":"What are the *arr ? - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, etc.","title":"What are the arr"},{"location":"Hardlinks/How-to-setup-for/","text":"How to setup for \u00b6 Here you will find a collection How to setup Hardlinks and Instant Moves(Atomic Moves) Guides.

I've also created a short guide HERE where I explain the settings for the most used applications. The main goal of DockSTARTer is to make it quick and easy to get up and running with Docker. You may choose to rely on DockSTARTer for various changes to your Docker system or use DockSTARTer as a stepping stone and learn to do more advanced configurations. DockSTARTer was actually my first steps in to the world of dockers. Note I'm not going to explain how to get dockers installed and running, I will only explain which folder structure we recommend. The paths mentioned below refer to internal paths for the containers! External paths depends where you mounted your share or your drives. For example /<path_to_data>/data , or even /data . Info The paths you use on the inside matter. Because of how Docker\u2019s volumes work, passing in two or three volumes such as the commonly suggested /tv , /movies and /downloads makes them look like two or three file systems, even if they aren\u2019t. This means hard links won\u2019t work and instead of an instant move, a slower and more I/O intensive copy + delete is used. Folder Structure \u00b6 Attention It doesn't really matter which path you use for your media and appdata, the only thing you should avoid is /home . Because user folders in /home are expected to have some restrictive permissions. It just could end up creating a permissions mess, so it's better to just avoid entirely. For this example we're going to make use of a share called data . The data folder has sub-folders for torrents and usenet and each of these have sub-folders for tv , movie and music downloads to keep things neat. The media folder has nicely named TV , Movies and Music sub-folders, this is your library and what you\u2019d pass to Plex, Emby or JellyFin.

These have been collected from either discussions on discord or that I created with help from others. Special thanks to rg9400 , bakerboy448 and Team Radarr. With Radarr V3, Custom Formats are much more advanced/powerful than with v0.2, although this also means a Custom Format is much more complicated to setup. After requesting at Team Radarr we now have the options to import/export the Custom Formats in a JSON format that we can use here what makes it easier to share the different kind of Custom Formats. I also made 2 guides related to this one. How to import Custom Formats . Where I will try to explain how to import the Custom Formats. How to setup Custom Formats Where I will try to explain how to make the most use of Custom Formats and show some personal examples that I'm using. That you can use to get a idea how to setup yours. Tip I also suggest to change the Propers and Repacks settings in Radarr Media Management => File Management to Do Not Prefer and use the Repack/Proper Custom Format. This way you make sure the Custom Formats preferences will be used and not ignored.

Audio is a multi-channel, lossless audio codec developed by DTS as an extension of the lossy DTS Coherent Acoustics codec (DTS CA; usually itself referred to as just DTS). Rather than being an entirely new coding mechanism, DTS-HD MA encodes an audio master in lossy DTS first, then stores a concurrent stream of supplementary data representing whatever the DTS encoder discarded. This gives DTS-HD MA a lossy \"core\" able to be played back by devices that cannot decode the more complex lossless audio. DTS-HD MA's primary application is audio storage and playback for Blu-ray Disc media. json { \"trash_id\" : \"dcf3ec6938fa32445f590a4da84256cd\" , \"trash_score\" : \"460\" , \"name\" : \"DTS-HD MA\" , \"includeCustomFormatWhenRenaming\" : false , \"specifications\" : [{ \"name\" : \"DTS-HD MA\" , \"implementation\" : \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\" , \"negate\" : false , \"required\" : true , \"fields\" : { \"value\" : \"dts.?(ma|hd.?ma)\" } }, { \"name\" : \"Not TrueHD/ATMOS\" , \"implementation\" : \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\" , \"negate\" : true , \"required\" : true , \"fields\" : { \"value\" : \"TrueHD|\\\\bATMOS(\\\\b|\\\\d)\" } }, { \"name\" : \"Not Dolby Digital Plus\" , \"implementation\" : \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\" , \"negate\" : true , \"required\" : true , \"fields\" : { \"value\" : \"[^-]dd[p+]|eac3\" } }, { \"name\" : \"Not Basic DTS\" , \"implementation\" : \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\" , \"negate\" : true , \"required\" : true , \"fields\" : { \"value\" : \"DTS[ .]?[1-9]\" } }, { \"name\" : \"Not Basic Dolby Digital \" , \"implementation\" : \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\" , \"negate\" : true , \"required\" : true , \"fields\" : { \"value\" : \"\\\\bDD(\\\\b|\\\\d)|(?<!e)ac3\" } }, { \"name\" : \"Not DTS X\" , \"implementation\" : \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\" , \"negate\" : true , \"required\" : true , \"fields\" : { \"value\" : \"dts[-. ]?x(?!\\\\d)\" } }, { \"name\" : \"Not FLAC\" , \"implementation\" : \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\" , \"negate\" : true , \"required\" : true , \"fields\" : { \"value\" : \"\\\\bFLAC(\\\\b|\\\\d)\" } }, { \"name\" : \"Not AAC\" , \"implementation\" : \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\" , \"negate\" : true , \"required\" : true , \"fields\" : { \"value\" : \"\\\\bAAC(\\\\b|\\\\d)\" } }, { \"name\" : \"Not PCM\" , \"implementation\" : \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\" , \"negate\" : true , \"required\" : true , \"fields\" : { \"value\" : \"\\\\b(l?)PCM(\\\\b|\\\\d)\" } }, { \"name\" : \"Not DTS-HD HRA/ES\" , \"implementation\" : \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\" , \"negate\" : true , \"required\" : true , \"fields\" : { \"value\" : \"dts.?(es|(hd.?)?(hr|hi))\" } } ] } TOP FLAC \u00b6 FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, an audio format similar to MP3, but lossless, meaning that audio is compressed in FLAC without any loss in quality.

HDR capture and displays are capable of brighter whites and deeper blacks. To accommodate this, HDR encoding standards allow for a higher maximum luminance and use at least a 10-bit dynamic range (color depth, compared to 8-bit for non-professional and 10-bit for professional SDR video) in order to maintain precision across this extended range. json { \"trash_id\" : \"e61e28db95d22bedcadf030b8f156d96\" , \"trash_score\" : \"290\" , \"name\" : \"HDR\" , \"includeCustomFormatWhenRenaming\" : false , \"specifications\" : [ { \"name\" : \"HDR\" , \"implementation\" : \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\" , \"negate\" : false , \"required\" : true , \"fields\" : { \"value\" : \"\\\\bHDR(\\\\b|\\\\d)\" } }, { \"name\" : \"DoVi\" , \"implementation\" : \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\" , \"negate\" : true , \"required\" : true , \"fields\" : { \"value\" : \"\\\\b(dv|dovi|dolby[ .]vision)\\\\b\" } } ] } TOP HDR (undefined) \u00b6 Some groups don't add HDR to their 4K release name so I suggest to add this Custom Format at the same score as you add one of your HDR Custom Formats.

Both are just names to describe the best possible currently for the movie. To be clear, the final digital films on the Mastered in 4K Blu-rays still only have the same 1920 x 1080 pixels of actual resolution as normal Blu-rays. But the argument goes that because these full HD files were derived from higher-resolution masters, their images will be more precise, with better colours, less noise, and enhanced sharpness and detail. Not least because the higher-resolution mastering process will provide more detail from the original print for the Blu-ray masters to draw on when going through their (hopefully\u2026) frame-by-frame compression process. Another important element of the Mastered in 4K discs is that they\u2019re all mastered with \u2018x.v.YCC\u2019 colour specification.

If the media isn't source quality/remux, then there will be a loss of quality every time. Also, once you go x265, typically that file is done. It can't be changed to something else without a huge loss of quality. Something like 95% of video files are x264 and have much better direct play support. If you have more than a couple users, you will notice much more transcoding. Just depends on your priorities. So basically if you are storage poor and just need to save space, use x265. The catch is if you want best quality x265, you need source quality files, so you still have huge file sizes. If you want maximum compatibility and the option to change your files to something else later, then x264. It's all really dependent on specific situations for different people Microsized & Wrong Source \u00b6 It's a shame that most x265 groups microsize the releases or use the x264 as source what results in low quality releases.

Quote x265 is good for for 4k stuff or 1080p if they used the the remuxes as source. If the media isn't source quality/remux, then there will be a loss of quality every time. Also, once you go x265, typically that file is done. It can't be changed to something else without a huge loss of quality. Something like 95% of video files are x264 and have much better direct play support. If you have more than a couple users, you will notice much more transcoding. Just depends on your priorities. So basically if you are storage poor and just need to save space, use x265. The catch is if you want best quality x265, you need source quality files, so you still have huge file sizes. If you want maximum compatibility and the option to change your files to something else later, then x264. It's all really dependent on specific situations for different people Microsized & Wrong Source \u00b6 It's a shame that most x265 groups microsize the releases or use the x264 as source what results in low quality releases. And the few groups that do use the correct source suffer from it.

After requesting at Team Radarr we now have the options to import/export the Custom Formats in a JSON format that we can use here what makes it easier to share the different kind of Custom Formats. I also made 2 guides related to this one. How to import Custom Formats . Where I will try to explain how to import the Custom Formats. How to setup Custom Formats Where I will try to explain how to make the most use of Custom Formats and show some personal examples that I'm using. That you can use to get a idea how to setup yours. Tip I also suggest to change the Propers and Repacks settings in Radarr Media Management => File Management to Do Not Prefer and use the Repack/Proper Custom Format.

IMDb IDs are going to be very accurate and rarely change, but they may be missing for some movies added to Radarr. TMDB IDs, on the other hand, do change or are removed more frequently, but Radarr will always have this ID for each movie. Original Title vs Original Filename \u00b6 Want to keep the original release name that holds like all the info of the file then I suggest to use {Original Title} over {Original Filename} Why? The filename can be Obscured where the Release naming isn't especially when you use Usenet. {Original Title} => The.Movie.Title.2010.REMASTERED.1080p.BluRay.x264-GROUP {Original Filename} => group-karatekid-1080p or lchd-tkk1080p or t1i0p3s7i8yuti Movie Folder Format \u00b6 Minimal needed and recommended \u00b6 { Movie CleanTitle } ({ Release Year }) RESULT: The Movie Title (2010) Note Keep in mind adding anything more after the release year could give issues during a fresh import in to Radarr, but it helps for movies that have the same release name and year. Hint Radarr does supports iMDb ID and TMDb ID in the folder name. Quote From the a developer TMDb is usually better as it guarantees a match, imdb only gets matched if the TMDb entry has the correct imdb Id association. We don't actually talk to imdb Warning Please note that folder names are created (in the database) whenever the movie is added to Radarr, and it may be missing or incorrect at that time and your folder would have a blank ID !!! If you instead add it in the filename, the IMDb ID will be freshly pulled for any download or upgrade. Another potential negative of using it in the folder is that folder renames are complex, lengthy, and potentially destructive in Radarr compared to file renames.

Quote From the a developer TMDb is usually better as it guarantees a match, imdb only gets matched if the TMDb entry has the correct imdb Id association. We don't actually talk to imdb Warning Please note that folder names are created (in the database) whenever the movie is added to Radarr, and it may be missing or incorrect at that time and your folder would have a blank ID !!! If you instead add it in the filename, the IMDb ID will be freshly pulled for any download or upgrade. Another potential negative of using it in the folder is that folder renames are complex, lengthy, and potentially destructive in Radarr compared to file renames.

Prefer Advanced Audio \u00b6 Lets say you prefer HD audio (with object metadata) Then we would use the following order. Basic Dolby Digital (DD) < AAC < Basic DTS (DTS) < DTS-ES < Dolby Digital Plus (DD+) < DTS-HD HRA < PCM = FLAC < DTS-HD MA < TrueHD < DD+ ATMOS = ATMOS (undefined) < DTS X < TrueHD ATMOS In this example above I have lossy Atmos over lossless DTS because the object metadata matters more to me over lossy vs lossless example Prefer HDR Metadata \u00b6 Lets say you prefer HDR metadata Then we would use the following order. HDR (undefined) = HDR < Dolby Vision I didn't add Dolby Vision (Single Layer) being most of the releases are already replaced by real Dolby Vision releases, If you still want to add it put it between HDR and Dolby Vision so they still can get upgraded. Also I didn't add 10 Bit being 4k releases are 99% 10bit anyway. example Prefer HQ Encodes \u00b6 If you prefer HQ Encodes (Bluray-720/1080/2160p) I suggest to first follow the Quality Settings (File Size) If you think the sizes are to big to your preference then stop reading and see if the other tutorials are helpful for you.

FAQ and Tips \u00b6 Proper and Repacks \u00b6 Proper and Repacks I also suggest to change the Propers and Repacks settings in Radarr Media Management => File Management to Do Not Prefer and use the Repack/Proper Custom Format. This way you make sure the Custom Formats preferences will be used and not ignored. Custom Formats to avoid certain releases \u00b6 How to use a Custom Formats to avoid certain releases? For Custom Formats you really want to avoid, set it to something really low like -1000 or even -9999 and not something like -10 . Being when you add a Custom Format what you prefer and you set it to something like +10 it could happen that for example the BR-DISK will be downloaded (-10)+(+10)=0 and if your Minimum Custom Format Score is set at 0 . Audio vs Audio Advanced \u00b6 What's the difference between Audio vs Audio Advanced? What's the biggest difference between these two ? The Custom Formats in the Audio are kinda global and not specific based on the best audio format. Personally I recommend to use the Audio Advanced they are already ordered from high to low if you prefer HD audio (with object metadata) Warning Don't use Audio Custom Format in combination with the Audio Advanced Custom Formats. Custom Formats with a score of 0 \u00b6 What do Custom Formats with a score of 0 do? All Custom Formats with a score of 0 are pure informational and don't do anything. Minimum Custom Format Score \u00b6 Minimum Custom Format Score Some people suggest not to use minus score for your Custom Formats and set this option to a higher score then 0. The reason why I don't prefer/use this is because you could limit your self when some new groups or what ever will be released. Also it makes it much more clear what you prefer and what you want to avoid. Audio Channels \u00b6 Audio Channels Personally I wouldn't add the audio channels Custom Formats being you could limit your self in the amount of releases you're able to get. Only use this if you got specific reasons that you need them. Using it with any kind of Remuxes Quality Profile is useless in my opinion being that 99% of all remuxes are multi audio anyway. and you can better score using the Audio Advanced Custom Formats Avoid using the x264/x265 Custom Format \u00b6 Avoid using the x264/x265 Custom Format If possible avoid using the x264/x265 Custom Format with a score, it's smarter to use the 720/1080p no x265 Custom Format. Something like 95% of video files are x264 and have much better direct play support. If you have more than a couple users, you will notice much more transcoding. Use x265 only for 4k releases and the 720/1080p no x265 makes sure you still can get the x265 releases.

If you do not want uncensored set it to -10000 . If you don't care either way just leave it out. The reasoning behind only 100 is so that it doesn't trump other release further up in the chain, this way it will trump maybe a couple release but not more. And -10000 to hopefully put it at the bottom of any tier list if you don't want it. / ( uncut | unrated | uncensored | \\b ( AT [ -_. ] ?X ) \\b ) /i Note When done it should look something like this: Second Release Profile \u00b6 Warning DO NOT Check mark Include Preferred when Renaming Must Not Contain \u00b6 The reason most of these are added is due to their shitty quality or just in general are not as good as other stuff that is out there.

Thanks a bunch!!","title":"Acknowledgements"},{"location":"Sonarr/Sonarr-Release-Profile-RegEx/","text":"Release Profile RegEx (WEB-DL) \u00b6 Advanced feature The regex isn't mentioned anywhere, it's a hidden advanced feature Sonarr V3 has a great feature called Release Profile. With this option you can fine tune your preference. The Release profile that we're going to use for this example is mainly to prefer P2P releases over Scene releases, (Scene releases are still being downloaded but upgraded). If you don't care about quality then stop reading and see if the other tutorials are helpful for you. FAQ FAQ \u00b6 Q: Why do you only have a release profile for WEB-DL? A: I only do WEB-DL my self for TV shows because in my opinion WEB-DL is the sweet spot between Quality and Size and you often don't see big difference anyway for TV shows. (Except for shows like GOT, Vikings, etc) Q: Why do you prefer P2P groups over scene releases? A: Scene release always release in a rush to bring it out as fast as possible. So I noticed often that I got Repacks/Proper releases from them or from different groups and quality. P2P releases are a bit smarter and work sort of together by not doing the same release. Also I noticed that with some Scene releases the 5.1 audio was stripped out or converted to AAC audio. And in my opinion the P2P are of better quality. Theirs 1 Scene releaser that do bring out quality releases -deflate/-inflate . Q: Why do I see that many Amazon WEB-DL's repacks/proper lately? A: A large portion of Amazon WEB-DLs in the last week have only had 192Kbps DD+5.1, because that's all Amazon made available initially. The proper 640Kbps DD+5.1 audio might appear a few hours later or a few months, but when they get updated the episodes will be REPACKED. Q: Why did you remove all the scene groups? A: I decided to redo the Release Profile to make it easier for me and the end user to update/manage the Release Profile, I decided not to add the scene groups anymore (and also removing the current ones). Why ? Lately I noticed a lot of popup scene releases meaning we need to update often. With this it also means all scene and (yet) unknown groups will be getting a score of 0 and not -50 . I will still keep a eye on them and add the Low Quality Groups to the -100 score and when I find a new P2P group I will add them, resulting in less updates and a more accurate upgrade. Propers and Repacks \u00b6 First we're need to make sure a P2P release isn't being replaced by a Scene Repack/Proper release !

It blocks/ignores 720/1080p releases that are encoded in x265, why ? Quote x265 is good for for 4k stuff or 1080p if they used the the remuxes as source. If the media isn't source quality/remux, then there will be a loss of quality every time. Also, once you go x265, typically that file is done. It can't be changed to something else without a huge loss of quality. Something like 95% of video files are x264 and have much better direct play support. If you have more than a couple users, you will notice much more transcoding. Just depends on your priorities. So basically if you are storage poor and just need to save space, use x265.

If you want maximum compatibility and the option to change your files to something else later, then x264. It's all really dependent on specific situations for different people It's a shame that most x265 groups microsize the releases or use the x264 as source what results in low quality releases.

With this option you can fine tune your preference. The Release profile that we're going to use for this example is mainly to prefer P2P releases over Scene releases, (Scene releases are still being downloaded but upgraded). If you don't care about quality then stop reading and see if the other tutorials are helpful for you. FAQ","title":"Release Profile RegEx (WEB-DL)"},{"location":"Sonarr/Sonarr-Release-Profile-RegEx/#faq","text":"Q: Why do you only have a release profile for WEB-DL? A: I only do WEB-DL my self for TV shows because in my opinion WEB-DL is the sweet spot between Quality and Size and you often don't see big difference anyway for TV shows. (Except for shows like GOT, Vikings, etc) Q: Why do you prefer P2P groups over scene releases? A: Scene release always release in a rush to bring it out as fast as possible. So I noticed often that I got Repacks/Proper releases from them or from different groups and quality. P2P releases are a bit smarter and work sort of together by not doing the same release. Also I noticed that with some Scene releases the 5.1 audio was stripped out or converted to AAC audio. And in my opinion the P2P are of better quality. Theirs 1 Scene releaser that do bring out quality releases -deflate/-inflate . Q: Why do I see that many Amazon WEB-DL's repacks/proper lately? A: A large portion of Amazon WEB-DLs in the last week have only had 192Kbps DD+5.1, because that's all Amazon made available initially. The proper 640Kbps DD+5.1 audio might appear a few hours later or a few months, but when they get updated the episodes will be REPACKED. Q: Why did you remove all the scene groups? A: I decided to redo the Release Profile to make it easier for me and the end user to update/manage the Release Profile, I decided not to add the scene groups anymore (and also removing the current ones). Why ? Lately I noticed a lot of popup scene releases meaning we need to update often. With this it also means all scene and (yet) unknown groups will be getting a score of 0 and not -50 . I will still keep a eye on them and add the Low Quality Groups to the -100 score and when I find a new P2P group I will add them, resulting in less updates and a more accurate upgrade.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"Sonarr/Sonarr-Release-Profile-RegEx/#propers-and-repacks","text":"First we're need to make sure a P2P release isn't being replaced by a Scene Repack/Proper release !
